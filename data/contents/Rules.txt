    You may not disrupt the normal playability of a zone or area.
    Zone/Area Disruption is defined as any activity designed to harm or inconvenience an individual or group(s) of players in a way that the game does not allow. This includes, but is not limited to:
        Continually killing players of the same fraction on a safe map.*
        Blocking any doorway of any building so players cannot enter. Blocking within a map with the intention of impairing the normal playability of the zone. Be aware that if there is another way to enter the map and a player(s) is disrupting one entrance, this might not considered blocking. During a Crusade or Siege it's "all out war". Blocking doors, entrances to maps and pathways is a legal tactic.
        Boxing a player is legal everywhere, except if it results in blocking of a doorway to a building.
        Bringing summons from the spell "Summon-Creature", Ogre Pots or any summon scrolls to the entrances of the Promise Lands and the Beginner Dungeon. However, area effect spells such as "Cloud-Kill" and "Poison-Cloud" are legal, as is the use of "Fire Bows".
        Refusing to cooperate with the other parties at a contested spawn site or a Game Master's (GM's) event after having been instructed to do so by a HelbreathUSA representative.
        Making excessive [spam] and inappropriate use of public channels of communications in general, town, guild, local and whispers.
        Intentionally causing excessive zone latency (creating excessive corpses, abusing spell effects, etc.).
        Causing intentional experience loss to other players (deliberately impeding fleeing players by blocking their escape route, intentionally training NPC's on other players, etc.).
        If you feel some one is disrupting the normal playability of a zone or area, please take screen shots and submit them with a TIXX at http://www.helsupport.com.
        * Any map where you are sent to jail for killing a member of town where the repetitive killing of any person by a singular person or guild is considered a "safe map" and could result in further action. Maps protected by the jail penalty are designed for leveling, and players should be allowed to do so without the domination of another player(s) killing them by PK (Same town). This is determined by Administration. Any map where you remain on the map for killing a member of town is deemed to be part of game mechanics and to be handled within the game by players. Maps that are not protected by the jail penalty are designed for hunting, and players should be able to do so with the knowledge that they are in a dangerous map. This is determined by Administration. As long as no 1 person or guild is being hunted down and killed specifically because they are that person or targeted because they are in that guild. Pit etiquette* is to be expected but not required by the person entering the area. As long as 1 group of people do not dominate an area full time. This is determined by Administration. * Asking if they mind your presence, reacting on their reply as you see fit.
    You may not defraud other players. Fraud is defined as falsely representing one's intentions to make a gain at another's expense, this is determined by Administration. Examples of this activity include, but are not limited to, using deception to deprive another player of items, slandering another player or impersonating them with the intention of causing harm to that player's reputation, or falsely representing one's identity in order to gain access to another player's items, account or account information also referred to as scamming.
    Sharing items in game is not supported by IENT, doing so is at your own risk. If you share your items with some one who shares their account unbeknownst to you, it is still your responsibility having given the items in the first place. We reserve the right to act on each report as necessary and treat each one as required. IENT takes no responsibility for lost or stolen items if you share your account. Accidentally selling items or passing them to another player is the responsibility of the player. If an infraction of any rule occurs the account is still liable for any punishment due. "It was my brother.." or friend or the family parrot does not matter. IENT doesn't support the sharing of accounts. By giving some one your account information, you are allowing them to do with your account as they wish. We will not restore, refund or place the punishments of their actions on their accounts. The account it happens on is the account that is punished.
    The game offers a "confirmation screenshot" service for people who want to share items. You, the lender are required to take a screenshot of the person you are lending your item to and have them clearly state that they will return the item when you request it. Screenshots MUST be kept up-to-date (within a 2 week time period) other wise they risk being invalid. You need to have proof that the item is being lent and not given. This does not protect you if the item is unintentionally lost by the sharer. If the item is lost accidently through a mis-click, the item can not be restored.
    We reserve the right to change offensive Character and Guild names or profiles without prior notification of the account holder.
    Laming is the organizing of the enemy to benefit yourself or your town. This is split in to two different sections.
        EKs are Enemy Kills and are used for getting Hero Gear and event items. Laming EKs is when the another character from the opposite fraction assists in being killed to facilitate the gaining of the EKs which are used to collect Hero Gear. Whether an EK is lamed is determined by GM1 through the use of game logs. Laming EKs is punished by the removal of all EKs and any Hero Gear previously gained on the account, not just the character. Repeat offenders will have a 20% exp removal. Kill toys, the characters which are killed in order to get the EKs will be locked and possibly deleted regardless of items held on the character.
        Crusade Points - During the crusade points are given by killing the enemy, random enemy town summons, enemy buildings and enemy units. Laming crusade points by organizing a member of the enemy town to create buildings with the intention of being killed by yourself or your guild or your fellow town people is laming points. Guilds who take advantage of the game mechanics by abusing in such a manner will have the Guild Master sent to bleeding island to break the connection between the summons and the Guild Master. If the abuse continues the Guild Master account will be locked for a minimum of a week and the guild will be disband.
    "It was a joke.." or "I didn't know" - is not viable as an excuse. Saying or doing anything that is normally punishable under our rules is still punishable despite the fact that you and the other person involved may have thought it all humorous or didn't know. No one else is in on the joke so it is taken seriously and dealt with in accordance with the other rules listed here.
    Item restoration is possible if iEntertainment is informed within 24 hours of the item being either sold to the Blacksmith or Shop Keeper. Scroll restoration is also possible if iEntertainment is informed within 24 hours of the item being depleted / learnt by the character. IEntertainment can not restore any items lost due to misplacement EG: Dropping on the ground or passed to another person (accidentally or intentional). Items lost due to sharing the item and or account information is not covered by this rule.
    IEntertainment is offering a slate restoration service to any slates lost due to disconnection. IEntertainment must be notified within 24 hours of the lost slate via TIXX at http://www.helsupport.com.
    You may not abuse your characters civilian stats in order to benefit or harm in a PvP situation. While iEnt understands that spying happens, actively taking part in any PvP situation in order to interrupt it intentionally will result in punishment. Using your civilian to watch the PvP is included, use a traveler instead.
